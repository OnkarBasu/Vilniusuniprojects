# 🚢 Vessel ETA Prediction Using AIS Data

## 📌 Project Overview
Predicting accurate vessel arrival times is challenging due to complex maritime movement patterns and varying environmental and operational factors. This project uses **Automatic Identification System (AIS) data** and machine learning techniques to predict **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)** with high accuracy.

The pipeline combines **data preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and a **Random Forest Regressor** to capture vessel behavior, spatial movement, and temporal trends.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict vessel ETA using historical AIS data  
- Identify key factors influencing vessel arrival times  
- Improve maritime logistics planning and operational efficiency

2. Feature engineering (temporal, spatial, behavioral)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Model training using Random Forest Regressor  
5. Model evaluation and insight generation

## 📊 Dataset Description

### AIS Dataset Overview
The dataset contains real-world AIS signals with the following attributes:

- Timestamp  
- Vessel Identifier (MMSI)  
- Latitude & Longitude  
- Speed Over Ground (SOG)  
- Course Over Ground (COG)  
- Rate of Turn (ROT)  
- Navigational Status  
- Heading  
- Vessel Dimensions (Length, Width, Draught)  
- Destination  
- Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Values
- Filled missing numerical values (ROT, COG, Heading, Draught, Width, Length) using **mean or median**
- Replaced missing vessel names with `"Unknown"`
- Imputed missing ETA values using the **most frequent value**
- Dropped records missing **critical navigational data** to ensure model reliability
